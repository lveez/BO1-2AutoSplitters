# BlackOps2Autosplitter
For redacted

Timer does splits automatically and also starts, pauses and resets automatically.

currently splits 5-6 seconds too early, so I need to find a better address for round changes.

add Scriptable Auto Splitter to livesplit and select the .asl file. Customize the rounds you want to split on by double clicking on Scriptable Auto Splitter and selecting them. You have to edit the rounds in Edit Splits manually, make sure they match the rounds selected.
